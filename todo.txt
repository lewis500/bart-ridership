a button to switch between entries and exits
instructions
put some transition on the mouseout
put total exits and total entries as properties on the main object, not on the "r" property

ADDING SWITCH CAPABILITY
rename the "r" property
change the tooltip and undraw references
create a "EntriesVsExits" function. it loads alternate ridership files and redoes the "locs" and also redefines the tooltip to say "entries" instead of "exits"
create a "chord" entries file and a locs entries file

can you just create the locs as a json on the disk and load it without need for the ridership file?

make the div on the tooltip into a little arrow
